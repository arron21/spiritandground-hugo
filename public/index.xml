      <description>I’m no good at “letting it go”:
vindictive; feel it building.
I’d love to shed some light on this:
what’s the matter with you?
I know, I can tell you&amp;hellip;
Want you to-
bow to the queen;
get on your knees,
and beg:
so I can show you the grace of mercy.
My gilded crown;
gently resting-
but I’ve got a mean streak;
same comfort you’ve shown me.</description>

      <description>On scattered tired evenings when I’ve had my fill of life at the moment, (a baccalaureate with nothing much to show for it, working three jobs I could have gotten without a degree), my dad can sense my uneasiness. Most episodes like this I stay away from him, knowing that he can see right through any normalcy I try to feign. A direct look in the eye, a “what’s going on?</description>

      <description>I sit here:
wishing for the birds,
dreaming of the rain forest.
At my desk,
I yearn for the cool brisk air on my face.
I wonder:
if I should have been a veterinarian,
like I dreamed as a child.
I wonder:
if the idea is a twisted pair
with my lack of math skills-
or, maybe that’s an excuse;
prolonged torture: masachist.
And so, I’ll be a therapist;</description>

      <description>“Is there anything you want?”
What a loaded question that felt like. It was my twenty-second birthday and all I really wanted, honestly, was my childhood back. How does one confess that to their mother, whose only work in life so far has been to make the dreams of her children come true? You don’t— I don’t, anyway. When I was seventeen, I moved to the Big Apple, wide-eyed with ambition that would lead me across the country.</description>
