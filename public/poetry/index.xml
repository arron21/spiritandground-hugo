      <description>I’m no good at “letting it go”:
vindictive; feel it building.
I’d love to shed some light on this:
what’s the matter with you?
I know, I can tell you&amp;hellip;
Want you to-
bow to the queen;
get on your knees,
and beg:
so I can show you the grace of mercy.
My gilded crown;
gently resting-
but I’ve got a mean streak;
same comfort you’ve shown me.</description>

      <title>A Romantic, At a Desk.</title>

      <description>I sit here:
wishing for the birds,
dreaming of the rain forest.
At my desk,
I yearn for the cool brisk air on my face.
I wonder:
if I should have been a veterinarian,
like I dreamed as a child.
I wonder:
if the idea is a twisted pair
with my lack of math skills-
or, maybe that’s an excuse;
prolonged torture: masachist.
And so, I’ll be a therapist;</description>
