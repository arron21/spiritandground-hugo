***

On scattered tired evenings when I’ve had my fill of life at the moment, (a baccalaureate with nothing much to show for it, working three jobs I could have gotten without a degree), my dad can sense my uneasiness. Most episodes like this I stay away from him, knowing that he can see right through any normalcy I try to feign. A direct look in the eye, a “what’s going on?” will bring me to tears instantly; my dad has always had this power, he can bring me to spill the existential haunts I try to keep at a calm ebb in my mind; a neurotic tide, really.

There are some things I keep to myself, of course, topics I’d like to spare him from; for example, the fact that my birth control is making me feel like Natalie Portman in _Black Swan_ doesn’t usually make it into the conversation. What does bubble up, though, are some of the ironic woes that all humans share; common to each of us, and yet fully capable of making an individual feel entirely alone; an effective demon, really. The pain of not achieving anything I thought I would by twenty-five is the apparition that shows up most lately; sometimes on days of lighter-fare, we dream about my future together.

My dad is good with all of this; incredible, actually.

On these sacred evenings, from his worn spot on the couch, he’ll tell me about his time at Berkeley; a semester stint at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. He’ll tell me about a pizza parlor there in town, where he and his friends used to hangout, and I’ll picture him: late 80’s gear, laughing and chatting over some arcade games, so vibrantly young and full of wonder—my dad, perhaps even more so than his children, brimming with deep-seated ambition.

He was an incredibly handsome kid with a charming smile that could make even the most confident person stutter; my mom says he was shy and incredibly respectful, a rascally old-soul even then. He was popular, always; a wrestler who looked like a real life A.C. Slater. Most times, I imagine him this way.

As he tells me about Berkeley, I see his life playing-out before him; as if on film. He reminds me how there wasn’t a wrestling team—how he truly struggled with that; how he could only talk to family once a week on a collect call, if he was lucky. The strain of it all seeps into every word, and all I can think of is the lost time between then and now. He would be upset if he knew I wrote this, if he knew I even thought of it…

but I do wonder, if we weren’t born; if **I** wasn’t born, who could my dad have been?

This isn’t a death wish. There is nothing I’d take back about being his daughter and him my father, which is an honor I treasure; this is just a wondering about a math-wiz with the looks of a movie star, and hard-learned resolve from growing up too fast. He could’ve been so many people in this life, and I can't help but to imagine him happier.

This time I have now to yearn and stretch through my cocoon, to struggle out of it, he didn’t have. Like me, he came home from college, defeated for one reason or another; worked at a restaurant as a temporary gig. Shortly after, I was born, leaving him a nineteen-year-old father; like so many of his ancestors before—like his father.

And, I wonder how this makes him feel on his own tired nights; I wonder if those nights ever really end, or if they keep him as regular company.

The other day I came home from work; likely in a depressed mood, likely not wanting to speak to anyone. I walked into the garage and saw my dad with a cardboard box sitting on the ground, reading a handwritten letter on lined paper. Just like his father, he squints; stubbornly pulling the paper farther from his eyes, at a stale-mate with his age.

The lettering looks like a teenager wrote it: pencil, curved letters, no format.

My curiosity perks, and I walk over and ask what he’s doing. In all his beautiful honesty, he shares this letter and the cardboard box with me. As his eyes graze each word, there is a glint and he’s right back there; just a kid. The box is filled to the brim with notes and trinkets from the past; some he remembers, some now have no meaning. He shares every piece with me, embarrassing or not.

If I want to know, he tells.

I find a ring in the bottom of the box; thin and silver, with a small black stone. To my surprise, he doesn’t remember who it belonged to. I can't tell if he’s conveniently lying; my mom is home and I can only imagine if an ex-girlfriend’s ring showed up— but I don’t care; he says I can have it if I’d like, and I accept.

I wear it now, this small mystery of my father’s youth; it sits, every day, every moment with me: a small time-capsule upon my finger.
