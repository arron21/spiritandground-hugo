**Young Wonder**

On scattered tired evenings, when I’ve had my fill of life at the moment (a baccalaureate with nothing much to show for it, working three jobs I could have gotten without a degree), my dad can sense my uneasiness. Most episodes like this I stay away from him, knowing that he can see right through any normalcy I try to feign. A direct look in the eye, a “what’s going on?”, will bring me to tears instantly. With a blink, he can bring me to spill most details that I try to keep at a calm ebb in my mind; a neurotic tide, really.

There are some things I keep to myself, of course, topics I’d like to spare him from. For example, the fact that my birth control is making me feel like Natalie Portman in _Black Swan_ doesn’t usually make it into the conversation; what does though, is honesty about my worries. The pain of not achieving anything I thought I would by twenty-five; a fear that I push away on the daily. So much fear. Sometimes, on good days, I talk about my dreams for the future.

My dad is good with all of this. Incredible, actually.

On these sacred evenings, from his worn spot on the couch, he’ll tell me about his time at Berkeley when he felt similarly to the way I do now. A semester stint at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. He’ll tell me about a pizza parlor there in town, where he and his friends used to hangout. I’ll picture him: late 80’s gear, laughing and chatting over some arcade games; young and wide-eyed. So much the same as my brother and I now: curious about life and full of wonder— my dad, perhaps even more so than his children, full of deep-seated ambition.

He was an incredibly handsome kid, with a charming smile that could make anyone stutter. I often picture him as I see my youngest brother: nineteen, and so vibrantly young. My mom says my dad was shy and incredibly respectful, a charming old-soul even then. He was popular, always. A wrestler who looked like a real life A.C. Slater. Most times, I imagine him this way.

As he tells me about Berkeley I see his life playing on film. He reminds me how there wasn’t a wrestling team— how he truly struggled with that; how he could only talk to family once a week on a collect call. The strain of it all seeps into every word, and all I can think of is the lost time between then and now. He would be upset if he knew I wrote this, if he knew I even thought of it…

But I do wonder: if we weren’t born, If **I** wasn’t born, who could my dad have been?

This isn’t a death wish. There is nothing I’d take back about being his daughter and him my father, this is just a...wondering; about a math-wiz with the looks of a movie star and hard-learned respect for others from growing up too fast.

He could’ve been so many people in this life.

This time I have now to yearn and stretch through my cocoon, to struggle out of it; he didn’t have. Like me, he came home from college, defeated for one reason or another. Worked at a restaurant as a temporary gig, and shortly after I was born: leaving him a nineteen-year-old father. Like so many of his ancestors before—like his father.

And, I wonder how this makes him feel on his own tired nights.

I wonder if those nights ever really end, or if they keep him as regular company.

The other day I came home from work; likely in a depressed mood, likely not wanting to speak to anyone. I walked into the garage and saw my dad with a cardboard box sitting on the ground, reading a handwritten letter on lined paper. Just like his father, he squints, stubbornly pulling the paper farther from his eyes, at a stale-mate with his age.

The lettering looks like a teenager wrote it: pencil, curved letters, no format.

My curiosity perks, and I walk over and ask what he’s doing. In all his beautiful honesty, he shares this letter and the cardboard box with me. As his eyes graze each word, there is a glint and he’s right back there, just a kid. The box is filled to the brim with notes and trinkets from the past. Some he remembers, some now have no meaning. He shares every piece with me, embarrassing or not.

If I want to know: he tells.

I find a ring in the bottom of the box; thin and silver, with a small black stone. To my surprise, he doesn’t remember whose it is. I don’t know if he’s conveniently lying; my mom is home and I can only imagine if an ex-girlfriend’s ring showed up— but I don’t care. He says I can have it if I’d like, and I accept. I wear it now, this small mystery of my father’s youth.

It sits, every day, every moment with me: a time capsule upon my finger.
