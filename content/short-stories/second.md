description: A story about nostalgia and warheads

**“Is there anything you want?”**

What a loaded question that felt like. It was my twenty-second birthday and all I really wanted, honestly, was my childhood back. How does one confess that to their mother, whose only work in life so far has been to make the dreams of her children come true? You don’t— I don’t, anyway. When I was seventeen, I moved to the Big Apple, wide-eyed with ambition that would lead me across the country. Growing up I felt that my only strength was my creativity. I drew constantly: wedding gowns, fairy gowns, you name it. I decided early on that I’d be the greatest fashion designer the world had ever seen. As soon as I graduated high school I left my parents and my brothers in rural California on scholarship to study Fashion Design in New York City, my opportunity to make something of my life. It only took four years and an internship to figure out the reality of the world I lived in. How ugly an industry that takes an art and turns it into a money-making machine could be. The words spoken at my last pitch remain branded into whatever synapse carries the burdened memory, “Wow, truly innovative, but not profitable. Thanks for coming in.”

My mother and I meandered through our local drugstore, The Mesa Market. This place

was a gleaming beacon of reward when I was a kid. It was at the end of the dirt road we used to live on, about a mile from our old front door. Fifteen years ago, and some hours, my older brother and I would walk there from the house. We’d race one other, I’d beg for piggy backs, dust covered our shoes and our hair. When we arrived, we’d buy ourselves whatever candy we wanted as a treat, eat it on the way back. Always a handful of Warheads for my brother,

Airheads for me.

**“Do you need any makeup?”**

My mom always asked this when we were at the store together, like second nature. As if makeup tied us together somehow, a relentless siren that demanded the same expectations of both of us. I looked around the aisle scanning hundreds of powders, lacquers, creams; everything wrapped in tiny plastic or cardboard containers. I felt torn between this yearn of wanting to peel into all the colors; beautiful arrangements of pigments— and my repulsion of everything these products stood for.

Aside from a few, most of them were geared towards one obvious thing: Beauty. The glossy packages and magazines with so-called beautiful women, all stung as representations of things that were now expected of me. The thought of it all rang through my mind like a high pitch tone when getting your hearing tested, and I wished I could press restart on my life. That I could go back before images like the red lips and winged eyeliner I was currently sporting suggested anything at all; not sexiness, not beauty, nothing. I suppose, according to what I know of human history, there never was a time like this, but I wanted it. As I looked at the aisle stretch of cosmetics I thought about the articles I’d have to write for my internship when I got back to New York. “​Givenchy Brings Back Blue Shadow​”, normally I’d have found it interesting in some way, artistic in some way, but not now. Now I wondered how I’d gotten myself into this mess. My painted face felt heavier as I looked around the store, and that little girl walking down a dirt road flashed into my mind.

Fifteen years ago and some hours, my brother gave me one of his Warheads on our walk back to the house. I was seven and not yet acquainted with the concept of painfully sour. He told me “it tastes like a blue raspberry jolly rancher”, and I took the bait. As soon as the citric acid hit my tongue, I spit that warhead at least ten feet in front of me.

Here’s what I really wanted to tell my mom I needed: I needed those times, back. I needed the acre of land that we used to live on. I needed the loose earth that I could make dirt angels in, and I needed the pile of 2 x 4’s to search for blue bellied lizards. I needed the horses that our neighbors had halfway down the road. I needed to feed them crab apples like I had fifteen years, and some hours ago. I needed to go back to the moment I looked at the setting sun behind our house, and thought, “I’m gonna be someone, I’m gonna make it.” I didn’t know what that meant then. I didn’t know that in my case, _​making it​_ required a high toll.

We moved out of that old house two months before my eighth birthday. My great

grandparents were dying and my grandma’s estranged siblings had started a legal battle over who would get the title of the land once their parents passed away. My own parents decided to move before the problem got any worse. I cried every day until we left, claiming I’d never call anywhere else home. Truthfully, I kept that promise. I remember my grandparents waving from the crest of the hill leading up to our house, the cactus and corn field fading as our truck bounced down the old dirt road for the last time. I’d never see it all that way again. Even this day, just a mile down the same bumbling road, so close I could sense every memory, I still wouldn’t be allowed to see it. A place entirely mine, and yet, not; a place entirely mine, and yet, someone else’s. I found myself wondering if they knew how often their home fills my mind...

**“Anna?”**

As I snapped into present time, my eyes focused on my mother. She looked so much

older than I had ever imagined she would. Wrinkles formed around her ears and eyes, lines that were deeper and more sallow looking than I ever remembered. I shook my head in response as we made our way to the counter, and my eyes fell to the rainbow of tiny twenty-five cent warhead packages that still, after fifteen years and some hours, sat in a glass fish bowl on the counter. As soon as my mom finished up her transaction I grabbed one, blue, and pulled a quarter out of my pocket.

“Just this, please.”

My mom looked at me and I braved a sad excuse for a smile and sentence, stating:

**“Ready?”**

I popped the candy into my mouth and the now familiar sting hit my tongue,

a sweet and sour taste I had grown accustomed to.
