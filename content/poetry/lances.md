I  see your whole life stretched out in front of me—

A wide, empty road;

Light glimmers,

Skips rock to rock

\-

The sun, golden 

as she reaches to hide herself beneath the horizon;

“Don’t go,”

I yearn;

But the clock beckons,

And the sun knows best.

\-

I know, why- you are,

I know, how- you became;

\-

I know the feel of your hand patting mine-

know the sound of your laugh

\-

Breathe in, breathe out;

Thin air- crisp and full

\-

I want to stay here… want to go…

\-

The wind lashes at my face;

\-

I know the sting of you turning away,

I remember

\-

I know what it feels to chase the sun;

To beg her to be mine

\-

I see her only here and there,

Glint on gravel again—

Too swift to catch,

Too fleeting to hold,

\-

Too punishing to trust.

\-

I know what it feels to be

Abandoned here,

Pleading

\-

Sunlight fractured on my face;

Taunting me as 

she pulls her lances

\-

Down into the ground;

Down past the earth;

Around to somewhere new—

\-

The sinking chill of a long, familiar winter.
