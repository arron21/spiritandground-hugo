**Cursed Blood**

***

A festering wound

This I know

Always within me

Scraping misery  
\-

Draining the life-blood

Of my ambition

\-

Alpha and omega

A flower pressing to bloom from the bud

Only to be stopped by the scorch of the sun—  
\-

Will I be the one?  
\-

Will I be the one?

\-

Let our fate, be unspun

Curse and blessing of what’s in me

Half-blood, young-blood, on and on...

\-

Can I fix it

All that I see?

\-

Far as the light can touch

Hey apa, is it enough?

I love you as you drink the cursed blood

It has its grips on you,

I understand that enough

\-

I’ll hold you as I have

Even when it courses through your veins

I promise like you’ve loved me, I’ll love you the same—

\-

I hope I can be the star

To show you

That one of us can make it out

Snuffed no more

\-

Tell me all about

Your times on the floor

And I’ll hold your hand as it shakes—
