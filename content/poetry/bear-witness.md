I ripped my eyes out;

sat within the ranks of Oedipus,

many recommended this—

\-

But I have born witness,

and I cannot un-see;

\-

tethered under your eyelids,

tight rope in your dreams;

\-

horrors dance.

\-

What can I do with this pain

but hold it in my palms,

and cry out, “I see! I see!”

\-

Though my voice shakes,

and I cannot breathe —

I can

muster

\-

“I have seen.”
