I ripped my eyes out

Sat within the ranks of Oedipus

Many recommended this—

\-

But I have born witness

And I cannot un-see

\-

Tethered under your eyelids

Tight rope in your dreams

\-

Horrors dance

\-

What can I do with this pain

But hold it in my palms

And cry out, “I see! I see!”

\-

Though my voice shakes

And I cannot breathe —

I can

Muster

\-

“I have seen!”

\-
