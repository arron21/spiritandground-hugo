Of course it crosses my cortex

Thought about it once or twice

This pretex.  
\-

The devils’ in the details

And I’m picking them apart  
\-

Just to see,

how primal are we?  
\-

Where does it end, when does it start?

\-

Am I some invalid?  
I feel like an angel sometimes

but I still want to see you sweat.  
\-

I see it across the room

Wouldn’t dare look at you

But I’m wearing a label that says drink me;

And hey, you’ve got one too.  
\-

Is it my age?

Makes me so...corruptible.

I’m trying to stay at the chapel;

Baptismal blessings

On your lapel.  
\-

Curiosity gets the best of me

Feline precocity

I’ve touched you before

Haven’t you had me?  
\-

I see it across the room

Wouldn’t dare look at you

But I’m wearing a label that says drink me

And hey, you’ve got one too

\-

I think you’re better in my mind

Close encounters of the seventh kind

And we’ve given birth to

The end of innocence.  
\-

Can I deny, furlough

The human haunts within me?

Biology, do I have that capacity?

Evolution

Is a state of mind,

No?

\-

Who gave us this disease...

Pandora pulls at me

I’ll come, if you say please.  
\-

Drink me;

Drink me;

Drink me.  
\-

Evolution is a state of mind, no?
