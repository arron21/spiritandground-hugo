Don't say to me "I will die for you."

Because you _have_ died a little

Each sun rise and set

Each work day

Each debt

\-

You have died a little each day

Before my very eyes

\-

I have known that you were killing yourself

Because life was killing you

And that I, perhaps, was killing you too

\-

My mind will never be free from this shackle

As yours has never been free of your father's

And he of his mother's

\-

You say to me "this is the way it is"

But it's not—

For some

\-

For some, life is a peaceful dream

Where their mothers and fathers wake easily

Where their every breath does not form the seal of their parent’s caskets;

\-

They will not know our ghosts

And these apparitions will not haunt them

\-

You say "I will die for you"

I say you do not understand the blow they have struck us

\-

These insidious voyeurs

Grinning shiny teeth as we grapple and clamor

\-

A false bible they have given us

To sit on their throne and say

"This is just the way it is"

\-

No.

I don’t have to bear their lies,

I won’t.

\-

You have lifted me higher

The backs of one hundred ancestors lay below my foot

Where you will lie

Lifting—

And I think you've forgotten

\-

Below the throned vipers feet

There is nothing but blood

And you are not them

\-

You say to me "I will die for you"

But I know the truth of it

They will go on draining you

Until they have bled you dry

\-

And you will believe you sacrificed yourself

And you will believe you have done it for me—

\-

So don't say this to me now

\-

Don't rest their despicable deeds

Upon my shoulders as a royal mantle

Don't say to me "I will die for you"

\-

because they have taken you, already.

\-
