You say “you should”—

“What a shame”—

As my tongue trips

On sounds that live in my blood.

\-

I think, but don’t say:

\-

In the United States,

There is a despicable legacy

Of stifling languages;

\-

Because, there is no should or should-not in genocide;

There is no shame, as you say;

There is only a conqueror,

El vencedor,

And death.

\-

And so I direct you

To the history books;

To my grandmother

Blushing at the sight of an English dictionary;

\-

And to the blaring fact before us:

\-

I now write quite heightened poetry—

In English.

\-

It is a shame presently, I agree;

A shame that even today

My ancestors are blamed, again—

For sparing me.

\-

I ought to say

“Unfortunately,

History is reflected in me;

Like a mirror my dear,

Don’t you see?”

\-

But today I am again,

Stifled;

\-

I will only mumble

“I agree, I agree.”
