I don’t know what my problem is-

why I’m here,

and not there—  
\-

If I ever loved you

If I do

If I love her

If I don’t  
\-

All this work

Just to be veiled again…

Is it the way of things, then?  
\-

This existence, this curiosity

\-

The real me

Who is she?

\-

How many I’ve been,

How many I’ll be...  
\-

Constellations ago;

Constellations to go;

Dust, dust, dust—

Sparkling;

Crumbling.
