I’m through thinking that

Life is forgiving

And maybe that’s what

Everyone

Has been saying  
\-

I’ve been fighting tough words with

Life is beautiful, mysterious

It is, it is;

But, it is not forgiving  
\-

Life is: at its core

Survival of the fittest...

Not forgiving

\-

Maybe that’s my youth speaking;

But I don’t feel young anymore.
