Sanctuary; refuge.

Sanctuary; safety.  
\-

This word has been soiled

Daggers hung from its neck  
\-

“We will not be a _Sanctuary City_ or country-”

You say;

Will you praise God in your next breath?

I'm waiting for the words, to snake from your mouth-  
\-

Refugees cry out, “sanctuary!”

And you slam shut the temple doors

Singing prayers of grace;

For whom, might I ask?  
\-

Heaven’s gate;

The one you long for

\-

Heaven’s gate;

Whose ticket you yearn for

\-

Will it be a place of sanctuary—

Open for you and yours?

\-

Or, will you stare at the same doors

Closed tightly before your nose

Crying for the same refuge,

Your ears fall deaf to?

\-

Will the blessed turn their faces from you, too?

\-

Will the angels of liberty snicker

Will they laugh at your shaking hands?

\-

And how then, I wonder—

Will you feel?

\-

With your paper crowns crumpled in your fists

Will you, in your desperation

Beg for a lamp at the golden door?

\-

You will cry for Sanctuary, I imagine

Weep for grace

lords and ladies of the United States

at their knees, pleading

for Sanctuary;

the audacity.
