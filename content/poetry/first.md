I sit here:

wishing for the birds,

dreaming of the rain forest.

At my desk,

I yearn for the cool brisk air on my face.

I wonder:

if I should have been a veterinarian,

like I dreamed as a child.

I wonder:

if the idea is a twisted pair

with my lack of math skills-

or, maybe that’s an excuse;

prolonged torture: masachist.

And so, I’ll be a therapist;

maybe then I’ll spend some time

in the trees,

instead of longing.

I wonder:

why do we say, "that’s the world we live in",

and still sign ourselves over;

chained to fluorescent lamps,

a constant burning of flesh-

years of a society

who stare longingly out the window;

if there is one.
