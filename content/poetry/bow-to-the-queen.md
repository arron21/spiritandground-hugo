***

I’m no good at “letting it go”:

vindictive; feel it building.

I’d love to shed some light on this:

what’s the matter with you?

I know, I can tell you...

Want you to-

bow to the queen;

get on your knees,

and beg:

so I can show you the grace of mercy.

My gilded crown;

gently resting-

but I’ve got a mean streak;

same comfort you’ve shown me.
