Something fierce grows—

It's crawling under me,

vigor of the wriggling.

\-

I; it's festering.

\-

It's a wound I know:

Same aching dream;

Little boy, shaking.

\-

I; it’s bleeding over me.

\-

Mama says I've gone mad,

But I just don't know;

\-

So what’s it gonna be? You tell me.

\-

Time bends like a bow;

It's all make believe,

I can feel what I need.

\-

The sun, it groans;

Calling out to me,

Mass of Mercury—

\-

What alchemy do I need to bring you back to me?

A life for a life;

Equivalent exchange,

Strife for strife?

\-

Just ask it, of me.

\-

You’re not coming home, and

There's a wall, I know;

\-

Is there something you’d like to say,

Before you float away?

Don’t see you there anymore,

And you’re not coming home;

\-

I know, I’ve known—

You’re not coming home.
