I think about-

How many lies

Drywall holds

In all its various cages

All its shapes  
\-

Echoing and bumping into one another

Seeking their makers and mates

Sirens and Lucifers

Compounding upon one another

Stifling the air

No wonder I feel so heavy here—

\-

Didn’t know it was the deceit

One here, one there

A white slipper

Which conforms to the human foot

So easily...  
\-

Silver-tongued sinners;

You’ve given birth to me,

And I entertain you

On the daily

\-

Sunlight! You dance on the leaves

I beg you

To dance upon me,

But I find myself unworthy  
\-

I,

Yearn for the kiss of the golden one

Whose quest to find me, I’m told, is as great as mine

But just as small

In this maze

\-

Silver-tongued sinners;

you’ve given birth to me,

and I entertain you

on the daily.

\-

Sunlight! You dance on the leaves

I beg you

To dance upon me

But I find myself unworthy
