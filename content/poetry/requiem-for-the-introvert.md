Inspiration makes for higher the fall

Harder the climb

Never mine at all

\-

And, I

All I need is solitude, an hour or two

A lifetime

My medicine will kill me

Heal me

Choke me

\-

I can't relate

I shake

On every word escaping my mouth

Wishing I could claw it all out

I've got to see someone

Sort it out  
\-

Who's watching me!

I'm normal, canâ€™t you see?

Leave me be!

\-

I emit this energy

Come to me

You, feeling my need

But I beg to be free

Wanting to bleed

Feel the earth gaping at my knees

Warm dirt, swallow me whole

So I can feel new

Again  
\-

I'm so tired

I long to return

To your humble hold

Gentle caress

Vines at my neck

\-

These convulsions

Radiate through my blood

Screaming to get out

Shaking the room

The street tilts on its axis  
\-

I'm just a place

Just a vehicle

A vessel

A chess piece on a map

\-

I can melt into it somehow

Don't you think?

\-

This water between

You and me

Is a solution

Is viscous

As viscous as we need

To bind 

\-

I feel the rhythm

Between me and the grass blade

Begging for my escape

In it's simple way

\-

But the more the inspiration

The harder the fall

And I'll wake up and go back to it all.
