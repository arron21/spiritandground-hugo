**Fu/g/ue**

A word looks so wrong sometimes

So different though you’ve known it all your life

I look at you sometimes

And I feel the same

I forget our language, the sound of your name...

\-

Our love has a shape; I see-

But I

Lose touch with r/e/al/it/y

\-

Symbols and letters of some kind-

As you know, I can be a coward

A prisoner to my mind

\-

You’re the same structure I’ve always known

A thousand times my mouth has called you home

Light bouncing on every shape

That makes you up

And says you’ve stayed

\-

But I don’t know if I know you/(me) right now

My tongue trips on the message

H/ow c/a/n I b/e s/ur/e

\-

Can’t hold a spark

‘Cause control is a daydream we have in the dark

Let it go and watch

It’s beautiful, from here.

\-

You always see so clearly

But I’m terrified to slip...

And so I

Grasp in the shadows-

To hold on

Even though I know-

\-

I know...

I know...

\-

Brains got a 404 on your file

I’m searching for the schemas

That helped me before

A s/of/t h/az/e, as ephemeral as o/ur d/a/y/s

\-

Right now I can’t put a label on you

Sure I’m scared, it’s true

Changing so delicately

Honey it’s n/ot l/o/s/t on me

\-

I’m terrified when I lose control

Want to make it memorable

Keep it in my sight

Grab it before-

\-

All my might

Just to hold you

All my might

Not to stifle something true-

\-

I’m a/fr/aid

Of this place  
\-

Where I don’t know  
\-

The light comes and goes

What misery is this?

What, bliss?  
\-

Every definition, lost

To stare anew

Study like a child

The facets of the world

Still, and wild

\-

Big eyes taking a swim

This always did feel like drowning.

\-

From the depths the light is rippling

As I pry at the surface

I should just enjoy this  
\-

And I’ve never so badly

I know-

Wanted to resist this fu/g/ue-

I-
